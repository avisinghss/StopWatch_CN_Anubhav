# Stopwatch Project

This is a simple stopwatch project built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project aims to create a functional stopwatch that can accurately measure time, allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer as needed.

## Features

- **Start**: Clicking the "Start" button initiates the stopwatch and begins the time measurement.
- **Stop**: The "Stop" button pauses the stopwatch, allowing the user to resume the timer from where they left off.
- **Reset**: The "Reset" button resets the stopwatch, setting the timer back to zero.
- **Time Display**: The stopwatch displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, providing accurate time measurements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The project utilizes HTML to structure the stopwatch interface and create the necessary elements.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style the stopwatch interface, providing an attractive and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript**: The functionality of the stopwatch is implemented using vanilla JavaScript. JavaScript allows for precise time calculations and event handling to control the stopwatch behavior.

## Usage

To use the stopwatch, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The stopwatch interface will be displayed, showing the current time as 00:00:00.000. You can then interact with the buttons to start, stop, reset, and record lap times as desired.
